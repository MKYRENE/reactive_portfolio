            <p className="indented-paragraph">
            I am a dedicated and accomplished professional with over 10 years of experience in the financial industry. Recently, I have pivoted my career towards the IT industry, completing a Codecademy course and earning a certificate in HTML. I am excited to apply my new technical skills to create innovative solutions that help businesses grow.

                In my previous roles in banking, I was consistently successful in meeting sales quotas and service goals. As an Associate banker at Wells Fargo, I brought in over $500k in house loan closing and $100k in new money for New Account openings (NAO) and referred $1.5M in investments close leveraging other branch channels. At Santander, I established relationships with personal and business customers, building a strong rapport with clients by facilitating consultation sessions to provide solutions with utmost confidence and clarity, with a heavy focus on small businesses and providing Small Business Lending & Payment solutions.

                I am highly competent in risk management, financial analysis, business analysis, and small business lending. Additionally, my new technical skills will allow me to provide innovative solutions for businesses looking to improve their online presence.
